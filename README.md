# What I Learned

In this project, I learned the following about PostgreSQL:

- How to install and set up PostgreSQL on my system.
- Basic SQL commands: `CREATE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- How to create and manage databases and tables.
- Writing queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Understanding relationships between tables using foreign keys.
- Using constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Performing joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- Basic indexing and performance optimization techniques.

This practice improved my understanding of relational databases and SQL fundamentals.
